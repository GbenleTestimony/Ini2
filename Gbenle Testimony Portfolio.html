                    at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria. I really love tech and building websites is fuelled primarily 
                   by my passion. I built this demo project to exercise my theoretical study of the Frontend architecture.

                        Hi!, I'm Testimony - a curious blend of medicine and technology. Currently a medical student at the University of Ilorin,
                        I'm deeply passionate about the future of healthcare and how technology can bridge gaps in patient care, especially through 
                        telemedicine. Alongside ny medical training, I've been learning software development, focusing on web technologies and Python programming
                        <br/>Whether it's diagnosing a condition or debugging a function, I'm committed to solving problems that matter - and I believe
                        technology is one of the most powerful tools in a future doctor's hands.

                    <p class="skillsp">The skeleton of the web. I use HTML to structure content meaningfully and semantically.
                         From creating clean layouts to integrating forms and media, it's the starting page of every page I build.

                        CSS helps me style pages to look just right. I enjoy exploring modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and I'm learning how to make 
                        my designs responsive, clean and user-friendly. A good UI isn't just pretty - it's purposeful

                        from automation to AI - make it an essential tool in both medical data analysis and software development. 
                        I'm especially drawn to its use in healthcare analytics and backend services

                        In a country where access to quality healthcare is still uneven, telemedicine holds the power to transform lives. I'm passionate about building or 
                        contributing to tools that bring medival help closer to people who need it - especially in rural or underserved arears.<br/> As I grow in both medicine and software engineering, I hope to merge these paths to create meaningful health - tech solutions that work in real - world contexts.
